<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Welcome to the Gym Landing Page project! This project aims to create a visually appealing and user-friendly landing page for a gym or fitness center. The landing page will serve as the online face of the gym, providing essential information, attracting potential members, and showcasing the facilities and services offered.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Customize the landing page to fit the specific branding and information of your gym. Here are some key files and directories:</p>
<ol>
<li>&#9989;index.html: Edit this file to update the content of the landing page.</li>
<li>&#9989;css/: Contains stylesheets. Modify or add additional styles in the existing files.</li>
<li>&#9989;img/: Place high-quality images for the hero section and other parts of the landing page here.</li>
Feel free to explore and modify the code to meet your gym's unique requirements.
